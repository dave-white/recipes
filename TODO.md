# TODO

## Priorities

-  Improve the UI on TV and mobile screens.  In particular:
   
   -  Make navigation buttons more easily utilized with the TV remote.

-  Create a test suite.

-  Quantity/servings multiplier.

-  Filtering and lazy loading of recipes on the main page.

## Stretch goals

-  Load recipes into and integrate with database---perhaps PostgresSQL using 
JSONB.

-  Create TV and mobile apps.  Set up an API for this purpose.

-  Migrate away from Material Tailwind; see the comment in ./react-app-env.d.ts.
